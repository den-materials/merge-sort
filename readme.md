#Merge Sort

##Objectives
*By the end of today's class, developers will be able to:*
- **Create** a merge sort algorithm in pseudocode
- **Understand** the principle of "proof by induction"

##Why Merge Sort?
Merge sort is one of the most powerful sorting algorithms that you will encounter. In fact it is the native `.sort` algorithm used in many JavaScript environments (such as [Mozilla's](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=224128)). It compares a list of elements using a "Divide and Conquer" strategy.

##How does it work?
Merge Sort works on the basic principal of dividing a list into sub-lists until your sub-lists are of length one or zero. Once your sub-lists are at that size, you merge with a neighboring sub-list. *Note, lists of size one are techinically already sorted.*

> Exercise: can we act it out?

##How would I build it?

-  A `mergeSort` function may take an array, cut it in half [recursively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)) until it has divided the whole array into single items. At this point the recursive calls finally starts returning to the function that invoked it. At this point a separate helper function, `merge`, could be called on a pair of sorted arrays merging them together (see visualization above).
-  The `merge` function takes two *sorted* arrays as parameters (an array with one element is technically sorted), looks at the the first elements of the two lists, and assembles a resulting list based on the two lists "zipped" together by pushing the lowest to highest valued elements.
